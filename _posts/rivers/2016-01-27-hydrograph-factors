####**Physical:** 

**Storm intensity and duration:**

>If both are high, a steep rising limb is produced which surpasses the infiltation capacity of the soil so water flows overland, reducing the lag time.

**Antecedent Rainfall:**

>Heavy previous wet weather means the soil is saturated so more surface runoff.

**Snow:**

>Heavy snowfall won't appear on the hydrograph immediately but will appear clearly when temperature rises and large amounts of water flow into the channel.

**Porus rock or soil:**

>Permeable rocks like limestone produce a less steep hydrograph as water moves more slowly through the underground system.

**Impermeable rock:**

>Cause more surface runoff, such as granite. This is as water cannot percolate into the rock.

**Drainage basin size:**

>A smaller drainage basin gets water to the river more quickly, means a shorter lag time.

**Drainage basin shape:**

>Reaches river more quickly from a round drainage basin, a shorter lag time.

**Slope angle:**

>Steep sided river basin, water reaches the river more quickly than in a gentle sloping basin meaning a shorter lag time.

**Temperature:**

>High temperatures increase the rate of evapotranspiration reducing discharge. The coldness may freeze the ground and increase surface runoff.

**Vegetation:**

>Varies with season, a shorter lag time in winter than summer as there's less interception by trees.

#### **Human:**

**Land Use:**

>Water runs more quickly over impermeable surfaces such as compressed soil (by cattles on farms) or caravan parks. The lag time is reduced by this so the peak discharge is increased.

**Urbanisation:**
 
>Man made impermeable surfaces such as roads or driveways force rain to flow through 'enhanced throughflow' drainage systems instead of infiltrating. This reduces the lag time and increases peak discharge
