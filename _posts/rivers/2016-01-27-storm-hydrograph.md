#### **The Graph:**

**What is a storm hydrograph?**

>A graph drawn to show the precipitation and discharge into a river as a flood progresses, as the drainage basin responds to the extended rainfall period.
>They also provide useful inforomation such as the flood's duration, total rainfall, time of peak flow and time time for which the peak flow lasted.

**Variables shown by the hydrograph:**

> * Precipitation (mm) - Bar chart
* Discharge (cumecs - cubic metres per second) - line graph
* Time (minutes, hours, days) - shown as either time since the flood started or hours of the day

**Data that can be interpreted from the graph:**

> * Storm duration
* Time of peak flow
* Amount of peak flow
* Total rainfall
* Time flood start/ended
* Intensity of flood
* Duration

#### **Definitions:**

**Lag Time**

> Time for the soil to become saturated and runoff becomes the dominant process.
>Time between peak rainfall and peak discharge

**Baseflow** 

> Normal water level, one both before and after the flood (as the water level is different after)

**Bankfull**

>When the river wwater level rises to reach the top of the banks and the water subsequently floods from the channel

**Rising Limb**

>Represents the rapid increase in discharge from the surface runoff and throughflow

**Falling Limb**

>The river discharge decreases and the river's level falls. Has a greater gradient as most surface runoff discharged. Mainly throughflow makes up river water.

**Peak Discharge**

>When the river reaches its highest level of the flood, after this it decreases.

**Surface runoff (or 'overland flow')** 

>Where water flows over the land surface during a flash flood as there isn't time to infiltrate the soil.
>This can also happen if the water is saturated.

**Throughflow**

>The water transportation within the soil but above the water table level. Throughflow transports water to the river, it will happen more quickly if the soil is saturated (as water isn't being absorbed into stores).

**Groundwater Flow**

>Water that has infiltrated the soil and has been transported through springs or the water table on its way to the river. Means it takes longer than surface runoff. 

**% Storm Runoff**

>The amount of precipitation that makes it to the river, '60% storm runoff' would mean that 60% of the water made it to the channel whereas the other 40% is absorbed in natural stores instead.

#### **Factors for hydrographs:**
*More of these are listed in the "how physical and human factors influence hydrographs" section.*

**Factors leading to a high hydrogaph (and flooding):** 

>**Surface Runoff:**
>
>>Water reaches the river channel faster than the river can discharge it causng the water level to rise.
>
>**Previous high rainfall:**
>
>>If rained heavily previously, soil would be saturated meaning minimal infiltration and more runoff.
>
>**Season:**
>
>>In summer evapotranspiration could absorb some of the water, preventing flooding. In winter the ground is easily completely saturated meaning minimal infiltration and more surface runoff.
>
>**Urbanisation:**
>
>>If the area has been largely urbanised and large areas of impermeable surfaces are created, a greater volume of surface will be caused which makes flooding more likely.

**Factors leading to a low hydrogaph (and no flooding):** 

>**Interception:**
>
>>Large areas of woodland around the drainage basin will intercept the rainfall delaying the time until infiltration (or runoff) allowing the water to infiltrate before being discharged and preventing flooding
>
>**High Evapotranspiration:**
>
>>More water is evaporated by the sun and absorbed by trees than is put into the transpiration stream leaving less runoff for the river.
>
>**Long dry period:**
>
>>Long dry period makes flooding less likely as the soil is unsatruated so more water can be absorbed into the natural stores. The water table would rise due to saturation leaving less runoff.
