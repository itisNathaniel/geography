The long profile starts at the source and moves down to the mouth, showing the valley's shape all the way down whereas cross profiles only show the valley shape at indiviual points. 

Cross profiles are useful though as they show what processes are happening and how wide the channel and valley are.

#### **Long Profile:**

* Moving down a river's course it gets flatter, starting very steep near the source
* Long profiles have a hollow and concave shape starting high and steep moving down to low and flat
* The cross profile shows the shape of the valley at different points in the course
* Near the source the river tends to flow down steep slopes, as it does this it erodes vertically cutting down towards the river bed, carving a steep V-shaped valley.
* Towards the mouth the river becomes much less steep and as it approaches the mouth will be flowing over almost-flat land.

#### **Cross Profiles:**

#### **Upper Course**

**Landforms:**

* Waterfalls
* Rapids
* Boulders
* Steep, uneven riverbed

**Erosion:** 

* Through hydraulic action and attrition
* Most erosion is vertical

**Transports:**

* Mostly large boulders
* Some suspension
* Little solution

#### **Middle Course**

**Landforms:**
	
* Rapids
* Small Meanders
* Small floodplain
**Erosion:** 
	
* Mostly attrition
* Some hydraulic action
* Less vertical erosion, mostly lateral
	
**Transports:**
	
* Smaller load
* Amount of suspension has increased
* Little solutiin
	
**Deposition:**

* On slip-off slopes
* Floodplain is built up in times of flood

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/image/rivers/lower-course.svg" style="width:300px;float:right;">

#### **Lower Course**

**Landforms:**
	
* Large meanders
* Levees
* Flood Plains

**Erosion:** 
	
* Mainly not happening
* Some lateral erosion on outside of meander bends
	
**Transports:**
	
* Small pebbles
* Gravel and sand 
* Mostly suspension
	
**Deposition:**

* Mostly fine particles
* Forms a slip off slope, levees and a flood plain
