A Hjulström curve can never start at 0 as it is a logarithmic scale on both the velocity and sediment size axis; this means for every increase by 1 it's 10x the value are 10x as big.

On the Hjulström curve there are two curves:

* the 'mean erosion' velocity curve which shows the velocity at which eriosion is happening at.
* There is also the 'mean fall' curve which shows the mean velocity that deposition is happening at.
* Between these two curves is transportation, the velocities at which the particles are carried in the water

#### **Interpreting the above Hjulström curve:**

**To interpret the curve:** draw a line from the particle size you're investigating up to the top of the graph, then move across with a line from the velocity, see which shaded area it's in at the velocity you're investigating.

|Size of particles in <br> river| Velocity particles picked up <br> (cm/s) | Velocity particles deposited <br>(cm/s)
