The Water Balance Graph shows water availability and use throughout the year, with the blue line showing Precipitaiton (mm) and the orange line showing E/T (evapotranpiration) of water (mm).

From the water balance graph above, it can be interpreted to show:

* There was a water surplus between mid-November and March due to more precipitation than E/T.
* The water utilisation period is between July and mid-June where all available water is being used.
* The evapotranspiration peaks between June and August due to less cloud clover which means higher temperatures so more photosynthesis happens causing more transpiration.
* There was a period of water deficit between late-July and September as natural stores were depleted.
* The recharge period was between September and November - where the natural stores refilled with water.
