There are many different orders of streams for rivers, starting at one. The stream number increases when two equally sized streams join together.

The point where the two streams join together is called the 'confluence'.

* **Order 1:** a first order stream has no parent streams

* **Order 2:** is formed when two first order streams join together

* **Order 3** when two second order streams join together

* **Order 4** when two third order streams join together

* and so on for **order 5**, **order 6** and beyond.

The largest known order stream is **order 13** in the Amazon basin (formed from two **order 12** streams). This size can only be estimated though as we can't easily measure each stream.
