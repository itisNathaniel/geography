**Drainage Basin:**

>The area drained by a river and all of its tributaries

**Watershed:**

>The boundary of the drainage basin, it's caused by a change in land balance such as mountains that cause runoff to flow in a different direction (and therefore into a different drainage basin).

**Sources:**

> The beginning of a stream or river

**Sources Examples:**

> * Springs (i.e: 'Big Spring' - Missouri, USA)
* Melting (i.e: (example: 'River Rhone' - France)
* Bogs (i.e: 'River Wyre' - Lancashire, UK)

**Braided Channel:**

>Where the river slows down and drops some of the sediment it's carrying, causing the water level to rise and flooding.
>More channels are made so the river has multiple routes.

**Confluence:**

>Where two streams join together

**Flood Plain:**

>The area that is flooded during floods, it is when the river valley has a wide and flat floor.

**Gorge:**

>Steep sided, narrow and rocky valley marking where a waterfall has retreated

**Rapids:**
> Where a river meets a band of resistant rock, before a waterfall

**River Cliff:**
> Created on an outer meander by erosive and fast-flowing water

**Slip-off Slope:**
> Forms on inside of meander's bend as a result of deposition in slower-flowing water.

**Tributary:**
> Where a smaller river joins a larger one

**Plunge Pool:**

> The deep pool below a waterfall

**Oxbow Lake:**

>A meander that has been cut off from the main channel then abandoned

**Levees:**

> River embankments built naturally as over multiple floods sediment deposition builds up.

**Meander:**

>The bend in a river.
>The outside bend has the fastest flow and deepest water

**Mouth:**

>Where the river ends, into a lake or the sea.

**Delta:**

>Where the mouth is filled with sediment causing the main channel to split into smaller branching channels

**Estuary:**

>The salt marshes that surround the river mouth (i.e: the Wyre Estuary)
