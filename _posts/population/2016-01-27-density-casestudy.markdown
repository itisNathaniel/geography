* **North** is heart of industrial england, most people still live here, many moved from the country during the industrial revolution. Most people either still live here and didn't migrate back to rural areas or returned during the city redevelopments
* **South Wales'** coal mines led to area being very densely populated due to people migrating for money
* **Birmingham** is UK's 2nd largest city and is in heart of UK, many businesses based there so high distrubution
* **London** is largest densely populatd area. Commercial and business capital of country. High land value and many jobs are based here

Brazil (LEDC) Population Density
</b></div>

* **On the east coast**, 90% of Brazil's population live in a 500km stretch of land, less than 25% of the country's total area
* **Country areas**, birth rate high, rapid outward migration to urban areas too
* **The northeast** has frequent water defecit, high temperatures and poor soils so no crops can be grown, nor animals. High birthrates and high infant mortality
* **To west**, large area of rainforest, drained by the Amazon and tributaries. Annual floods and wet and humid climate, lots of disease.
