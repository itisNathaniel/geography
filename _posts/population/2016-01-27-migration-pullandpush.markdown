**About:**

* Migration follows distance decay model
* Further away the migration is, the less migrants move there
* People are more likely to migrate to nearby countries (i.e. UK citizens more likely to move to France than Nigeria)
* Economic migration however can defy this and be over longer distances (i.e. Australia)
