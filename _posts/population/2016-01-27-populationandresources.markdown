* **Malthus** - *pessimist*
	* Shows population increase faster than supply of food
	* Over time population continues to increase beyond food and people start to starve
	* Population increases faster, increasing the food shortage
	* When food supply increases so does population up to point of crisis with potential war or violence
	* Urgent radical action needed to reduce the growth of population
	* \- Didn't predict DTM so model wasn't aware of stage 3's birth rate decrease due to contraception
	* \+ Not entirely incorrect as growth in food supply is starting to level off

* **Boserup** - *optimist*
	* Thought as population increased as would the food supply
	* Theorised technology would advance sufficiently to feed everybody
	* As limits of food supply approached by population increase, the food supply would simply be increased to feed everyone
	* Said supply of food and other materials would be increased by: finding more of it, extracting more if available, using alternatives, reorganise society more efficiently to cope without resource
	* \+ Very optimistic and is what has happened up to date
	* \- Accounts for a community without migration, as with migration demands increased further

* **Club of Rome simulation**
	* Most influential model
	* Advanced computer simulation published in 1972
	* Investigates increasing industrialisation, rapid population growth, widespread malnutrician and an environment that's deteriorating
	* Compares all factors to predict famine
	* Uses 1900-1970 values
	* Shows up to 1975 increase in resources but after that a constant decrease 
	* Shows population rise from 1.6bn in 1900 to 3.5bn in 1970 but shows population decrease from 1940 onwards

| Frequent famines in less developed countries                                                         | Enough food to feed everyone already but it isn't distributed evenly enough                                                                        |
| Can still be applied today as technology cannot advance  infinitely                                  | Natural disasters are likely to cause famine, many exports are cash-crops like cotton instead of  using land for local needs like the cotton trade |
| Supporters argue it may be okay now but won't be forever                                             | New farming tools and equipment have increased efficiency of farms to give the greater yields                                                      |
| Many people believe food supply wars are yet to come, and  are already happening in struggling LEDCs | Green revolution of GM crops potential to develop crops with 8 times usual yield                                                                   |
