China - One Child Policy
</b></div>
* **About**
	* Introduced 1979 and phased out October 2015 (all couples permitted 2 children)
	* Only allowed couples to have one child unless they were an ethnic minority, the first child was disabled or a girl (if agricultural family)
* **Enforcement**
	* Enforced mainly in urban areas, law followed more strictly there and harsher consequences
	* Rural areas rules more lax, officials bribable to be an exception, farms also made exceptions for as need men to work them
	* Rich people weren't really affected by the law as fine was around £520 
* **Why was it introduced?**   
	* To limit China's growth, designed as just a temporary measure
	* Was a result of China's change from an agricultural to an industrial economy after a large famine, and another large famine was predicted
	* Baby-boom followed the famine and population growth too fast to be sustanable
	* Famines left villages littered with bodies, not enough food to go around, with a population predicted to grow to 1.8bn, the policy stunted it at 1.4bn and saved hundreds of thousands of lives

* **Implementation**
	* Local government responsible for enforcing policy and punishments
	* Extra child causes fine in most provinces, in some can also seize property and remove jobs
	* Couples who follow policy get government benefits, pension benefits, preferential treatment for government jobs, tax breaks and free water

	| **Success**                                                         | **Failure**                                                                      |
