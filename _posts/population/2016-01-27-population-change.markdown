* Natural change = birth rate - death rate
* Migration = immigrants - emmigrants

**Factors that can affect natural change:**

* Pro-natalist and anti-natalist policies (France/China)
* War (as those of child bearing age go off to fight)
* Natural disasters (as many die)
* Technological advancements (cures for diseases, etc) 
* Developments in a country, better hospitals and public services

**World pattterns:**

* Over last 15 years population growth rate has slowed significantly
* Medicine, improved jobs for women and contraception as well as smaller families have made lives longer
* Natural increase peaked globally at 2.2% but since reduced down to 1.2%, still growing at 80 million people per annum though
* Low growth rate in late DTM stages (i.e. Europe and North America), in 1995 homed 20% of world population 
* Asia has a rapid but declining  growth rate, by 2050 India and China will be the biggest contributers to world population

**Why does growth slow at later DTM stages?**

* Health 
	* As country grows has better infrastructure
	* Infant mortality rates decrease, less malnutrition, contraception available and more sanitation
	* As children are more likely to survive people have fewer children
* Education
	* Health education means increased time in compulsory education
	* Literacy levels increase and greater provision of further eduction
	* Such as Malawi
* Culture
	* More distance from religious law, more enforcement of national law
	* Religious attitude to birth control prevents its use at early stages
	* There's a status gain from more children, whereas at later stage less children so more disposable income
	* Women have an improved role in society, moving on from not working and staying at home to have children
	* Sexual morality, outlawing of raping and enforcement
* Social
	* Better care for the elderly
	* Radio and other media availability 
	* Utilities such as clean water provision
