* **How DTM is affected:**

	* In UK most of the population working age, more people working than young and the elderly so less dependants and population is not aging
	* Migrants have therefore offset the UK 1960s 'baby boom'
	* In Poland nearing an aging population as clear gap in age structure where migrants have migrated in search of work
	* Clearly more men than women in these age group who have migrated and left their families at home.

* **How DTM is affected:**
	* Mexico's population structure largest at bottom and sparse at the top, many young, few elderly
	* Mexican centre of population pyramid disproportional as many people of working age moved out
	* Many Mexican dependants too, high taxes on the people to remain to cover education costs
	* In the US, most populous at age 20-65 as unwanted jobs filled by Mexican migrants
	* Less dependants and larger workforce so should be lower taxes
