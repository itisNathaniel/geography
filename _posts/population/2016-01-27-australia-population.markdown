Australia - Population Optimum
</b></div>

* **Australia's Population should be increased or decreased:**
	
	| **For increasing Australia's population**                                                       | **Against increasing Australia's population**                                            |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Agriculture is feeding 56 million people and and outside Australia already can feed more        | High population growth rate due to high immigration rate                                 |
| Mining provides for need of population, more mining would help improve economy for inhabitants  | Despite BR being below replacement level, natural increase in total population           |
| Environmental damage already done and cannot be reversed, no more harm                          | Water supply very seasonal                                                               |
| Farmland available and could be used                                                            | Disagreement as to how many Australia can support and the impacts more people could have |
|                                                                                                 | Some argue Australia overpopulated and 10 million would be better                        |

* **Planning Population for next 20 years:**
* Look at population desnity for areas sustainable for human living and whether they can home more people
* Calculate [***human and cultural carrying capacity***]({% post_url 2016-01-27-keyterms %}#country)
* Could support more Sweedish and Ethiopians than Americans as they consume less and use less resources so would impact the environment less
* To keep continued growth would beed a 3% efficiency rate but currently only 2%
* Reverse desertification to make more areas habitable
