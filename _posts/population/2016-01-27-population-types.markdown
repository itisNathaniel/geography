* **Optimum Population:**
	* All resources used efficiently to give the highest standard of living to everone
	* Dynamic so will respond to changes in technology adjusting the standard of life

* What affects optimum population:
	* Technology developments
	* Changes to demographic structure
	* Faster trade opportunity and development
	* New raw materials to replace exhausted ones, improving quality of life

* **Overpopulation:**
	* Too many people compared to the available resources and technology 
	* Low standard of living which would be improved by having less people depending

* **Underpopulation:**
	*  Too few people to use resources efficiently
	*  Increase in population would increase living standard and the effective use of materials

* Technology influence
	* Better technology in MEDC so higher population density 
	* LEDC may be of same size and have lower population density but still be overpopulated due to the lesser technology
