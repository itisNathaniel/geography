Kerala - Alternative population policy
</b></div>

* Why was the policy needed:
	* Population of 32 million 
	* Makes up 3% of India's populatation
	* Population density 820 people per square km
	* Population growth will be 10% per decade, half of India average 20% per decade

* Focus of their policy
	* Reducing population growth through benefits to those to conform 
	* Girls treated equally as boys, improving opportunities through equality
	* People educated as to benefits of smaller families
	* Infant mortaility reduced so people don't feel need to have as many children
	* Improving health of children through vaccination
	* Encouraging higher marriage age
	* Allowing maternity leave only for the parents first two children
	* Retirement benefits to smaller families provided
	* People encourage to be more self-sufficient through land reform

* Policy implemetation
	* Didn't need enforcement as doesn't punish those who have more children, they just don't get the benefits
	* People encouraged to participate as policy
		* Improved quality of life
		* Gave freedom to participate in social and political activities
		* Educated people of small family advantages
		* Free contraception provided, people encouraged to use it
		* Free education to those who abide to policy
	
* Policy problems
	* People have two many children don't have enough land to suffer on, so suffer financially
	* Only works in Kerala, rest of India's population still growing rapidly, some people also abuse system by moving into Kerala for free adult literacy and benefits
	* Expensive to educate so many people, many people for state to pay for

* Has it worked?
	* Reduced birth rate successfully 
	* Reduced infant mortality (13/1000 Kerala - 40/1000 India)
	* More girls go to university than boys
	* Adult literacy allowed people to advance careers
	* Free libraries improved job prospects, higher skilled jobs
	* Land distrubuted so nobody without it, but those with smaller families are better off
	* GDP is higher than rest of India ($1,600 Kerala - $1,500 India)
	* Population density 3x Indian average
	* Growth rate is slowest in India
	* Stage 4 DTM whereas India itself is stage 3
	* India between now and 2025 still expected huge growth, has worked for Kerala but India is still increasing
