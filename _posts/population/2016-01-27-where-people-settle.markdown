**Examples of where people do and don't settle:**

* **UK** - Densely populated due to flat land, economic power and good utilities
* **US** - Large amount of USA inhabitable sandy desert and mountains, mixed climates and some areas inhabitable by humans. On other hand areas like New York attractive due to economic power and services
* **Brazil** - Lowland with a lot of forests which are inhabitable. Hot climate with most country dry in winter. Most plants are tropical. East coast very densely populated
* **Sudan** - Hot climate with very little rain, dry during winter mean few crops can grow. Hard to live due to desert, mostly flat land
* **Australia** - Centre of Australia desert, area mostly sand and stone desert with little vegitation and mostly flat land
* **China** - China has a large desert in middle. Majority of population live in dense outskirts, some areas have no dry season, others are never wet.
* **Russia** - In Russia in rains in summer and dry all winter, many high mountainous areas, north is cold. People only want to live in main areas of lowland that have a good climate


**Characteristics:**

* Table of what causes dense and sparse populations:

	|                | Cause a dense population                                                                             | Cause a sparse population                                                                            |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Physical**   | Flat planes, lowland                                                                                 | High, steep mountains where temperature and pressure lower with altitude. Active volcanoes           |
| **Climate**    | Areas with reliable rainfall and consistent  throughout year                                         | Areas low rainfall or unreliable seasons                                                             |
|                | No temperature extremes, but consistent sunshine too, i.e. costa del sol                             | Seasonal droughts, high humidity like the Amazon. Cold like Northern Canada                          |
| **Resources**  | Natural Minerals that mean infrastructure can be build                                               | Areas without minerals so have no energy resources, i.e. paraguay                                    |
|                | Mines to create jobs so people move in, i.e. Pittsborough, USA                                       | Leached soils so crops struggle to grow, thin soils too                                              |
| **Historical** | Industrial revolution moved people into city centres for work, more jobs: i.e. China                 | Wars made people leave cities and evacuate countries, i.e. Syria                                     |
| **Political**  | Creating new cities to move people too, such as Brazilia to deal with overpopulation                 | Areas where not enough money to encourage  development, such as Brazil interior. Corrupt governments |
| **Economic**   | Areas with intense farming can support many people on small areas of land, such as the Netherlands.  | Delicate economies, i.e. no harvest means that there's no ability to survive                         |
|                |                                                                                                      | Lack of jobs in countryside due to agricultural technology                                           |
| **Human**      | Well developed, affordable health service such as NHS in the UK                                      | Malaria prone areas, high risk of death, poor health service                                         |
