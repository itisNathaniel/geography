Aging Population - UK
</b></div>
* **About:**
	* UK in stage 4 of DTM due to a low birth and death rate, low infant mortaility and steady population growth
	* Hasn't yet reached stage 5 as there aren't more retirees than those of working age (20-65)
	* Most UK jobs are in the quaternary sector (knowledge based)
	* Industry no longer part of UK economy
	* 6% unemployed, 15% living in poverty

* **Population Structure:**
	* UK population mainly made of those between 40-54 years
	* Less people in retired age range showing UK population not yet aging
	* Aging population risked in next 40 years
	* Although migration has helped boost this age range to delay aging

* **Impacts of aging population:**
	* Creates state dependance issues where many elderly rely on fewer taxpayers to support them 
	* Healthcare more money spent on elderly as spend 13 nights in a hospital bed compared to 7 when of working age
	* Taxes rise as a result as more money needed to pay elderly
	* Shortage of workers means employers need to attract more people into the workplace, perks like flexible working hours
	* Economy sector change as elderly create greater *grey market* for services like holidays and retirement homes
	* Higher pension savings reduce investments so less economic growth as people save money for their retirement
	* *Grey vote* means that policies more tailored towards the elderly than younger people as they're the largest group of voters, policies such as investment into medicine

* **Managing an aging population:**
	* Increasing investment into medical services to help cure diseases
	* Raising working age, by 2020 UK working age will have increased from 65-68 years which delays population aging
	* Hiring foreign labour delys aging as migrants fill the age 20-40 gap (works in old East-Germany)
	* Encourage births, used in France to increase the birth rate, now has 1.9 fertility rate which is highest in Europe by giving out financial incentives.

Youthful Population - Uganda
</b></div>
* **About**
	* Uganda has high proportion of people (60%) under 16 years old and therefore meaning it is an youthful population  
	* Country has population of 35 million in area of 250,000kmÂ²
	* At stage 1 of the DTM due to high BR and DR and one of Africa's fastest growing countries
	* Locals greatly affected by HIV and AIDS and poor health services 

* **Population Structure**
	* Since 1960 when population 7 million, increased to 40 million in 2014 
	* Population quadroupled in 50 years
	* Fertility rate is 5.9 children per woman (2014)
	* People have large families as mostly primary sector (agriculture) work so more people to help out
	* Death rate strained health services
	* Roughly 6000 woman die a year from childbirth 

* **Causes of being youthful**
	* Low attendance to secondary education, only 18% attend school so not educated about contraception or health
	* Contraception not available widely, only 15% of 15-19 year olds use it
	* Most families are low income so are unable to afford healthcare

* **Effects of being youthful**
	* Rural to urban migration pressures local people to find jobs in the city, which they are underqualified for so have to resort to crime
	* Teenage pregnancies reduce career prospects for women so stay at home and increase dependants on a struggling country
	* High fertility rates strain healthcare which has a 39/1000 infant morality rate
	* Houses are lacking basic services and overcrowding happening
	* High population damaging the environment as people need land and resources for firewood and fuel  

* **Managing youthfulness**
	* Strategies to reduce birth rate such as encouraging contraception to save money in healthcare
	* Family planning clinics aren't widely available and birth control isn't available, a wider availability would prevent continued growth as seen today.
