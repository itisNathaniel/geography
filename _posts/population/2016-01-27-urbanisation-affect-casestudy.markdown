Urbanisation MEDC - Canning Town, London UK
</b></div>

* London contains some of UKs most deprived areas
* Three kilometres from Canary Wharf suburb of Canning Town 
* Residents suffer low income, poor health, high crime and a life expectancy 9 years less than the UK average
* Most housing social, but high rise tower blocks were demolished in 1990s so most homes now have gardens
* Canning Town however still has unemployment above average at 6.7% and 1/10 people work part-time

* Problens faced by local people:
	 * **Expensive housing** as the homes are cheaper than most London, but still unaffordable to local people, few large family homes
	 * **Low income** as in 2007 average income £23,000 per houshold (£10,000 per person). Only 37% of people in full-time work, this lowers average income
	 * **Poor health** as 21% have poor general health and 10% are disabled
	 * **Low education achievement** as of 2001, 40% of working adults have no qualifications
