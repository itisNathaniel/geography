**Population Density**

* Measure of how many people live in a given area
* Expressed as people per square kilometre 
* Calculated by:

\\[ People\ (per\ 1km^2) = \dfrac {Country\ population} {Area\ of\ country \ (km^2)}\\]

* Can also be applied to smaller areas using same formula, i.e towns and villages

**Population Distrubtion**

* Way of describing where people live
* Even distrubition means each area has same number of people living in it (i.e. 6 people living in every square kilometre)

**Showing density and distrubution**

* Chloropleth map
	* Average population density in a country
	* Doesn't show distrubtion 
* Dot map
	* Shows population desnity as areas with more dots closer together
	* Less dense areas have less dots
	* \- Do not show country borders
	* \- Don't clearly show distrubtion if multiple dots overlapping
* Topological Map
	* Useful to represent distrubtion
	* \+ Can easily be compared
	* \+ Shows the most populous countries
	* \- Boxes make it hard to work out exact population and no numbers
	* \- Not geographically accurate
