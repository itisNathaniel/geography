	* Kimmerage grown from 87-110 people
	* Corfe Castle geown from 1,380 to 1,460 from 1960 to 2001
	* Outward migration has provided better economic opportunities and cheaper housing
	* Birth rate 10/1000 and death eate 12/1000 showing a natural decrease in population
	* Fewer younger people overall as they migrate away for better opportunites
	* Inward migration of retiring elderly

* **Housing issues:**
	* House prices risen 14% from 2000-2013, 15% more than national average
	* Competition for housing from commuters, retirees, 2nd home buyers and local people
	* House prices made own town unaffordable for locals as average wage is only Â£500 a week
	* *Right to buy* means fewer council homes available for locals too
	* Local people have to move away as can't afford to live there

* **Decline in service:**
	* 75% of villages found to have no shops, 38 post office have closedm 8 villages lost pubs, 35 petrol stations closed 
	* Reduction in church services with change to a single vicar covering a large area
	* Local shops couldn't compete with chain supermarkets on price

* **Transport:** 
	* 4 buses for whole area
	* As commuter village most don't need bus service, few elderly are left with no way to move around
	* Some volunteers have to run own minibus scheme
	* Railway closed 1972 due to lack of users
	* Most people dependant on own cars to travel around

* **Rural Deprivation**
	* Low standard of living in an area
	* Measured by how much unemployment, average income and services available
	* Different types
		* Household deprivation where low income homes have little access to housing, goods, services. Especially vivsible in areas with dramatic increases in house prices
		* Lack of health, social and education opportunites, so less potential jobs in the future
		* Mobility deprivation where people cannot get around
	* Most visible in Purbeck locals as commuters tend to be of higher income

	* Has a National Trust property
	* Hotel and 4 pubs
	* Primary school, Library and GP surgery 
	* More housing assosiation properties built recent years
	* Mostly servies retired but some commuters too.

* **Rural Decline Problems:**
	* Most people deprived and can't afford to move so stuck there
	* Many homes are bought as second homes, so is a *ghost town* out of season
	* Elderly and poor without resources
	* Areas become more isolated as more people leave

* **Rural Expansion Problems** 
	* Housing estates built for more than local people can afford
	* Little activity during the day
	* Conflict of interest between residents and migrants
	* Congestion increased by two cars per household
