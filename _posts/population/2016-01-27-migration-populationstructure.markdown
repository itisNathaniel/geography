**Internal Migration**

* Migration from rural areas to urban areas affects the number of people of reproductive age (young adults)
* Through rural-urban migration they move into cities to find work, affecting the birth rate for the area too
* In a village, it would be expected there would be a lower 0-60 population and an especially low 20-40 range, who go to cities seeking jobs

**Emigration**

* There's elderly people moving abroad decreasing the UKs elderly and increasing the elderly population at their destination

**Immigration**

* At late DTM stages in MEDCs there's immigration of people of a working a reprodutive age, the workforce and young population are increased (such as with the UK)
* This late stage migration is often encouraged to compensate for fewer native people working there and the immigrants pay taxes to help the local economy.
