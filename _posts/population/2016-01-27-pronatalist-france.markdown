France - Pro-natalist population policy
</b></div>

* **What is pro-natatalist?**
	* Policy which encourages having more children through incentives
	* Aim to increase the young population
	* Incentives both economical (paying for each child) and social (i.e. provision of free education)
	* Designed to prevent the population aging by boosting the workforce

* **Why is it needed?**
	* France has low fertility rate as it's late stage DTM so 40% of its population are dependants
	* Contraception available so people choosing not to have children until later life or at all as they advance their careers
	* Population retiring, €12bn spent on pensions every year
	* People are getting married later

* **When was it introduced?**
	* *Code de la famille* introduced in 1939 and banned all use of contraception
	* Contraception ban clause repealed in 1967
	* Introduced due to dire need to stop population aging

* **Incentives**
	* £1064 per child 
	* Maternity grants support women on leave from work
	* Policy pays for maternity leave for 20 weeks for the first child and 40 weeks for the 3rd child at full pay
	* 100% morgage payment for those who have 3 children and preferential allocation of those who have more children to council houses
	* 30% price reduction for public transport
	* Free childcare
	* Encourage mothers to work part time or take one day a week of work for childcare

* **Policy issues**
	* Outlawing contraception caused large STD spread
	* Over 30 different measures for who was eligible for what on the policy, hard to calculate peoples benefits
	* Policy not effective at increasing birth rates any further, likely to remain at 2.01 births per woman and not increase any further

* **Was it a success?** 
	* Ineffective until mid-1940s
	* Baby boom from 1943-1965 meant there were 14 million births compared with just 9 million deaths
	* Overall worked well as reduced dependance ration and created a larger workforce to support elderly 
	* Although population still has many elderly there's enough people to stop the population aging
