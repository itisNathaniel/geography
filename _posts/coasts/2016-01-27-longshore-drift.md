* The process where sediment like sand and silt is transported down the coastline
* Takes place in the littoral zone (closest to the shore) and waves are responsible for it

* **How does it happen?**
	* As waves approach coastline at an angle the sediment is carried up the beach, then backwash pulls the sediment back into the sea at a right angle
	* Causes a right-angle zig-zag movement in the direction of longshore drift 
	* As waves approach the beach the wave hits the seabed and topples forward, and breaks
	* As it crashes down, the wave can pick up sediment (size depends on size of particles on sea bed and wave power)
	* More powerful waves can move heavier sediment
	* Direction of waves depends on prevailing winds, if they're travelling north-west, the waves will follow the path and pick up the sediment and carry it down the shoreline
	* Forms spits and bars

* **What affects it:**
	* Groynes stop longshore drift as the sediment piles up on one side of the groyne reducing sediment along the shore
	* If longshore drift stopped, it acts as natural sea defence and wave power and erosion is reduced

* Evidance
	* Can be clearly seen at Fleetwood and Cleveleys with the sand building up on one side of the groynes, preventing movement of sediment down the coastline

* Management
	* Continual movement of sand by wind and tides, Wyre Borough Council manually move the sand back down the coast to preserve the beach and protect homes from damage
	* Also allows preservation and regeneration of sand dunes
	* Fylde uses groynes that reduce movement of materials down coast by longshore drift but causes issues with beach deprivation down the coast where there isn't enough sand on the beach to stop erosion there
