**Wave-cut platforms**

* Formed more easily by soft rocks such as clay which are more easily eroded
* Platforms only visible at low tide and as large areas of flat rock
* Wave-cut notches are when waves undercut cliff base by abrasion and hydraulic action causing the rock to collapse 
* Parallel retreat is when two hedlands retreat together at the same rate inland from the coast
* Harder rocks like granite more resistant to erosion

**Formation**

1. The top of the cliff is weakened by the freeze thaw process (1)
2. A large wave-cut notch (4) is then formed by abrasion and hydraulic action which then is converted into a wave cut platform as the sea erodes the cliffs back. Cave formed under the notch and the rock above the cave eventually collapses when the cave cannot bear the weight
3. Eventually the cliffs collapse down as they have no support below (5). Backwash carries the rubble out to sea where it will b used to erode another cliff by abrasion
4. Process repeats

**Cliffs**

* Coastal features present where the land is made of more resistant rocks, cliff height is decided by difference between sea level and land height
* Hard rocks weathered slowly, less cracks rock hass, the less it will weather as most weathering from freeze-thaw, so water cannot cause expansion if it cannot enter the cliff
* Strongest cliffs made out of granite and basalt as softer rocks like clay erode more easily

**Headlands and Bays**

*A discordent coastline*

* Form along discordent coastlines (where geology alternates between bands of hard and soft rock)
* Means erosion happens at different rates, more slowly on more resistant rocks leaving headlands where the hard rock is but creating bays where the soft rock is

*Headland and bay, wave refraction*

* As a bay formed there's increased wave refraction around the headlands so erosion increased on headlands but decreased i nthe bay
* Bays are less likely to to form on concordent coastlines (where all the same) but requires freeze-thaw weathering in large areas (done in ice age)

**An equilibirum coastline**

*  Where coastline inputs and outputs equal, materials moving in equal to materials  moving out
*  Large rock deposition moving other rocks out for example
*  When balanced there's negligible change as they all cancel and a reduced impact
*  If one element changes due to external influence (i.e. a storm causing rock collapse) the equilibrium must be returned to (i.e. moving sediment out to sea

**Bay-head beaches**

* Develop at most inner part of bay
* As wave action is not very strong, deposition occurs
* Beach doesn't extend all the way to headlands as erosion from waves is stronger in the deeper waver
* When waves hit headlands they diffract into headlandss and power of waves exerted on them instrad
* Less power needed as they reach bay head beach so deposit their sediment and don't erode

**Erosional Headland Landforms**

* Erosional landforms form on headlands where the bays to either side have eroded further back to leave only a protruding rock to be eroded
* As headland itself is eroded by hydraulic action and abrasion, the harder rock is worn away in the following steps:

	| **Crack**       | When hydraulic action or weathering creates hole in rock                                                                                                                                         |
| **Cave**        | When wave forced into the formed cracks, sand or other particles to wear away rock by abrasion                                                                                                   |
| **Paired Cave** | When cave crosses through completely                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Arch**        | When two caves formed from either side meet in middle leaving a space between the two pieces of headland. Cap remains over the top but is unsupported between the stack and the mainland         |
| **Blowhole**    | Roof of arch collapses inwards allowing air to move in and spurt out under high pressure when water flows into cave beneath                                                                      |
| **Stack**       | Entire arch roof collapses leaving upright sections of rock detached from main headland out at sea                                                                                               |
| **Stump**       | When stack eroded by abrasion, wave cut notch undercuts it and causes rock to topple over and leave only flat stump. Stump below sea level so cannot be eroded further. Only visible at low tide |
