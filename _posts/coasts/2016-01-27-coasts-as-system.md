* Coasts are natural system, not a clear cut land/sea line
* Sediment
	* Most visible and main part of the system
	* Coast width changes between high and low water mark (the boundaries)
		* Tide can move slightly above high water mark and very far below low water mark

* In a restricted area of the coastal system (i.e. Cleveleys Beach of the Fylde Coastline) the coast acts a system

* **Complete coastal system input and output list:**

| **Inputs**        | **Stores** | **Outputs**     |
|-------------------|------------|-----------------|
| Longshore drift   | Beaches    | Longshore drift |
| Beach nourishment |            | Sand quarrying  |
| Wind erosion      |            | Dredging        |
| Cliff erosion     |            | Sand dunes      |
| Rivers            |            | Offshore        |
| Offshore          |            |                 |

* ***Sand dunes** are not a store as the sand is beyond the limit of the coastal system and is inland*
* ***Offshore** is beyond the limit of the system so is not a store as the sediment is unlikely to be brought back inland*
