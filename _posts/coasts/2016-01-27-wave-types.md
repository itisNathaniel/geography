*Movement of waves on a beach*

* **Waves**
	* Created by energy transfer as wind blows over sea surface
	* Wave energy dependent on
		* Wind Strength
		* Time of wind blowing
		* Distance wind blows over (fetch)
	* As waves reach shallower water, the friction increases and waves slow down
	* The height of the wave increases until i moves forward and plunges down, breaking on the beach
	* The wave breaks when the height is greater than 1:7 the length of the wave

*Constructive and Destructive Waves*

* **Constructive waves**
	* Long wavelength up to 100m 
	* 6-8 waves every minute
	* As waves break they lose energy and volume as they percolate into beach
	* Weak backwash, little or no sediment removed
	* Material moved up beach as a result so berms form

* **Destructive Waves**
	* High waves with a steep form
	* High frequency with 10-14 per minute
	* Steepen near the beach and then plunge down, creating a large and powerful backwash back into sea
	* Stops or reduces the next wave's swash
	* Very little material is moved up the beach
	* More commonly found on steeper beaches far away from where material is dragged down
	* Storm beach ridge is created of material waves can't reach
