* **When**
	* Happens when there is a redution in energy
	* Can be short term (beach sand movement) or long term (spits and sand dunes)

* **Bay head beach**
	* Most common type of deposition as wave energy used on headland as little energy the wave has left so it just deposits
	* Beaches such as the Fylde coast are short term as sediment from the beach trasported up the coaost
	* Spits are *fingers* of sediment and depend on longshore drift caused by river estudy directing sediment or land dirction change
	* Bar is hwhen the spit completely blocks off an area 
	* Tombolo is where longshore drift and beach extend all the way out to an island (i.e. Chesil Beach, Dorset)
