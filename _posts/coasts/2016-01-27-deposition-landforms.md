**Beaches:**

* Make a buffer between waves and coast, dissipate wave energy without experiencing change, in *dynamic equilibrium* with surroundings
* Accumulation of material deposited from low spring tides to large storm waves
* Gentle gradient beach produced as small particle size means sand compacted and wet so little percolation possible
* Two main beach profile types, wide and flat or narrow and steep
	* Depend on amount of wave energy and whether they're constructive or destructive
	* Depend on particle size, as shingle beaches are steeper than sand beaches as bigger grain size which allows more percolation
* Most swash returns as backwash and little energy is lost to friction, material moved down coast by longshore drivft
* Ridges and runnels form at low water marks, ridges and show where the high tides have been in different storms and runnels where water returns to sea as tide moves out
* Shingle may make up the whole or just the upper part of the beach
* Storm beaches are caused by a strong spring tide from large constructive waves carrying the largest sediment
* Ridges below spring-tide level show high tides

* usps are depressions when waves break on the sand and then swash or backwash 
* As waves crash on beach, material dragged back by backwash causing bay to form and leave horns in the sand
* Ripples developed on sand by tidal curents which show where weak currents passed over, perpendicular to flow of water

**Spits:**

* Long narrow area of land, one side connected to mainland, other is reached out into sea 
* Composed of sand and shingle, depending on the surrounding sediment
* Larger material deposited on the spit as it moves around the bend to the hook
* Finer material carried into salt marsh behind spit, rougher maiterial left behind it
* Spit recurves into a hook at the end as waves refract into the bay
* Spit pushed back towards land in times of storms
* UK examples: Hurst Castle (Bournemouth) and Spurn Head (Yorkshire)

**Bars:**

* Occur when spit entirely blocks a bay, enclosing it from one healand to another
* Only happens when no strong flow of water from land
* Area behind bar known as Lagoon
* Lagoon may become salt marsh due to low energy causing more deposition
* Example is Slapton Ley, Devon

**Tombolos:**

* When a spit extends far enough out to join an island

**Salt marshes**

* Low energy with shelter from wind and waves, provided by spits 
* They require a large amount of sediment from sea and rivers so tend to form around river estuaries
* They cause issues as can interfere with sailing
* When formed provide a habitats for many rare creatures
* Example is Parkgate, Wirral and is protected by the RSPB due to the large number of rare nesting birds there


* **Formation:**	
	1. Firstly mudflats form by fine-material deposition which slows currents
	2. Sediment is then trapped by cordgrass which builds up a muddy area and stabilise the already deposited material causing an even faster buildup of materials
	3. Pioneer plants colonise the area; such as halophytes which are able to tolerate the salty water forming a large root system, enabling the plant to trap mud and sediments from the estuary
	4. Over time pioneer plants get deeper roots and are able to hold around 2 metres of material to form the marsh
	5. Vegetation develops further around the sediment to hold it in place and plants can grow on top of the marsh, slowing currents even more.


**Sand Dunes**

* Require a large amount of sediment, such as are present on tidal flats (areas with large tidal ranges between low and high tide) as well as a strong and wind to move sand grains in via saltation.
* Found in areas that face the prevailing wind direction
* Grains build up behind obstacles such as rocks and over time an embryo dune is formed.
* Eventually on top of the embryo dune pioneer plants start to grow and bind the sand, increasing the dune’s stability
* Example is Formby, Merseyside 
* Over time the vegetation traps sand and causes the dune to grow more starting the ‘sand dune succession’ cycle which can be seen here:

	1. Embryo Dunes
		* Form in shadow of obstacles at strand-line
		* Conditions harsh to life so have to adapt
		* pH is 8.5 so very few plants grow
		* Long roots needed to get to water but also traps sand
		
	2. Foredunes
		* Vegitation traps sand to stabilise the dune
		* Vegitation decreased pH to 7.5 so more hospitable to life
		* Long roots bind more
		* Marram grass is fast growing so binds all the sand

	3. Dune Stacks
		* Large depressions in the dune, deep enough to expose water table
		* Can be formed from large foredune that stops sand moving behind it
		* Dune stack low point below ridge
		* Can form where trampling reduces stability and erodes down the dune leaving a large hole
	
	4. Grey/fixed dunes
		* As plants on foredune dies, layer of soul formed which lowers pH to 7
		* Organic content of foredune gives a grey colour and it's now a fixed dune
	
	5. Climax
		* Forms at end of cycle, soil closer to pH 5
		* Allows vegitation like trees to grow
		* Called plagioclimax if humans interfere with the dune cycle formations
