* **Transportation**
	* Longshore drift
		* Both a good thing and an issue
		* Moves millions of tonnes of sediment anually
		* Caused by onshore winds on the coast at an angle
		* Movement of sediment in direction of prevailing wind
		* Requires a lot of management
		* Happens along Fylde coast
		* Requires a beach to happen 

* **Weathering**
	* Subarial weathering
		* Cliffs weathered by rain but not the sea itself
	* Biological Weathering
		* Gradual breakdown of rocks in their position
		* Prominent on the coast as regular wetting and drying as well as vegitation, organic acids and microorginisms

* **All types of weathering**

	| **Types**          | **What happens**                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Freeze-thaw        | Water percolates into cracks and freezes to form ice, it then expands in volume 10% and widens the gap. As it happens regularly some fragments of rock are broken away at bottom of cliff. Affects mostly  chalk and other porus rocks |
| Salt weathering    | Salt water present in tidal zone which evaporates to leave salt crystals which grow over time and exert  a stress on the rock in the way ice does. Causes rock to break apart, and corrode if contains iron                            |
| Wetting and drying | Frequent wetting and drying of coastline, clay rich rocks expand such as shale which then start to crack when dry and contract                                                                                                         |
| Carbonation        | Slow dissolving of calcium carbonate in rock as Co2 absorbed to form weak carbon acid. Happens more at colder temperatures as more Co2 absorbed                                                                                        |
| Biological         | Plant roots prise apart the cliff rocks and cracks widen and depend, water also moves into the roots  so more chemical weathering too. Organisms from sea burrow into rocks and secrete acids                                          |
