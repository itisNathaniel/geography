* Coast is *zone* between the land and the sea
* It changes over time, tidal from low to high tide
* In North, largest tidal range is shown by Morecambe Bay
* Salt marshes are on the land side of high-water marks, as are sand dunes
* Coastal zone covers offshore (where waves form) to onshore (where they break)
* Coastlines are affected by Erosion, Transportation, Deposition but areas tend to have one of these acting predominently 
* Most erosion happens during storms
* Erosion is affected by:
	* Rock type
		* Soft rock erodes faster and sumps down into sea (like clay)
		* Hard rock erodes more slowly (like granite)  
	* Hard defences
		* Fetch of waves influence how powerful waves are
	* Coast shape 
	* Availability of sediment
	* Prevailing wind direction
	* Change in sea level (eustatic change - whole world affected)
	* Isostatic Land movement

* Coasts in UK most likely to experience greatest coastal change in future are Norwich, Peterborough, London, Scunthorpe and Bournemouth where the land is dropping up to 0.8mm every year.

* As sea level rises:
	* In future starvation could be caused as world currently at productive food limit, so flooding would reduce productive land hugely so the whole world couldn't be fed
	* People living in most main cities would become displaced as cities destroyed
	* People living in main cities would be displaced as cities destroyed
	* Less land for people to live in 
	* As countries get more water covering the land them, harder to move around
