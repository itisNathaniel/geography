**Renewable energy** - can be replaced, not limited in quantity

**Non-renewable** - cannot be replaced (within our lifetime) and is limited in quantity 

**Reserve** - a store of energy, available for use

**Flow resource** - a continuous resource, like wind or tide

**Stock resource** - limited amount of a resource which when used will not be replaced 

**Critical renewable resource** - self-generating if left to nature, if not used carefully existance can be threatened (i.e trees as fuelwood)

**Non-critical renewable resource** - means it can be used over and over again. Such as solar and wind energy that can be repeatedly used

**Sustainable development** - development that meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the needs of future generations

**Primary energy** - energy sources in raw form such as oil, natural gas and wind turbines and water which can be used to provide secondary energy. 

**Secondary energy** - manufactured power sources such as electricity or petrol which are converted from a primary energy resource

**Fossil fuels** - oil, natural gas, coal which are formed from fossilised plants and animal remains. They are non-renewable resources

**Electricity** - a form of energy from primary fuel sources, carried by large powerlines and the available energy can be increased on demand
