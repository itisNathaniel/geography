Nigeria Energy Crisis	
</b></div>

* Fuelwood environmental impacts
	* Contributes to deforestation
	* Unsustainable wood gathering puts forests under pressure
	* Desertification has meant crop decline
	* Water table drop and less rainfall mean less trees
	* Fuelwood use rising as more trees cut down for more people

* Power generation issues
	* National electrification scheme has been attempted multiple times over 30 years and failed
	* Have 80 power stations built in 1980s but only 15 work
	* Most energy from HEP and gas, making equivilant of 20 watt per person (not nearly enough)
	* Transmission isn't effective as large amounts of electricity lost over long distances
	* Some HEP stations functional but many in disrepair 


* Independant Power Plants
	* In 2000 law passed to allow independant power stations to open instead
	* Government invested in IPPs as know only effective large scale method


* How renewable has helped
	* Solar panels used to provide IT in addtion to water wells
	* Most communities dependant on biomass for lifetimes (burning wood and local waste) 

* Intiative quick facts
	* *Lagos state solar poject* built a 50MW solar plant, effective as 2,000 sun hours every year. Allows cheap energy for locals to work and cook with. Aims to generate 500MW in rural areas and allow people to be completely off grid
	* *EGI Electrification Programme* built a 31MW powerstation powered by nearby gas field and renovated the electrical network with more transmission lines. Gas more useful here as so near to gas pipes
