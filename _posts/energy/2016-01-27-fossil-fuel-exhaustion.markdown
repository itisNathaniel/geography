**Oil formed**

* Crude oil formed from the remains of dead animals and plants crushed by ground above over millions of years
* Forms:
	1. Millions of years ago thousands of plants died and fell to the bottom of the sea
	2. Mud was buried by more more soil over time and as temperature and pressure increased it became rock, as boiled became crude oil
	3. As oil is less dense than the rock it rose up and was trapepd by the impermeable rock

**R/P ratios**

* Reserve to prodution ratio is remaining about of a non-renewable resource in years
* 'R' is resource and 'P' is production rate
* Used to describe areas petrol or gas supply
* Calculated by dividing reserves by extraction rate, to give the number of years left at current use
* Only accounts for current reserves and resets as more reserves are discovered (40 years ago: 40 years of oil remaining, 10 years ago: 40 years of oil remaining, now: 40 years of oil remaining)

**Difficulty calculating R/P**

* As large areas where oil located not accessible by man so reserves are incalculable
* Oil figures manipulated by OPEC to increase prices
* If higher market value reserves that were previously uneconomical to extract become economical
* Oil currently predicted to last until 2100
* Shell overstated oil reserves by 30% in 2005 to increase stock balue
* Estimate generally oil reserves remaining around 161 billion tonnes of oil remaining 

**Oil future:**

* Total consumption is 27Gb of oil per year, due to increase due to population rise
* Competition for remaining reserves means UK will need to use more sustainable methods instead or face inflated oil cost
* Price hike like happened in 1970s OPEC would increase oil price to Â£4.50 a litre
* Gradual oil increase would encourage electric car adoption
