* **Micro-hydro power**
	*  Small scale energy generation harnessing falling water from mountains and steep rivers
	*  Can generate power for homes, schools and hospitals
	*  Used in Zimbabwe, Sri Lanka, Kenya
	*  Mini-system can generate for around 20 years with little maintenance
	*  Works by redirecting river channel through powerhouse to a turbine
	*  \+ No environmental impacts and better than large scale HEP which damages marine life
	*  \+ Cheap, only costs Â£1,200 per KW
	*  \+ Increases availability of energy as currently 96% are without a power supply
	*  \+ Can provide enough power to light 200 homes

* **Small-scale wind power**
	* Rural areas stuck with no energy supply but need power for their technology like phones or tools for agriculture
	* Usually would have to send batteries away to recharging centre which takes weeks or months
	* Local turbines charge batteries and also can be connected to water pumps, hospitals and houses
	* Can be 5-10KW in size
	* \+ Means children have light to continue to work after sundown
	* \+ Saves money and waiting hours to get water (walking to nearest stream or well
