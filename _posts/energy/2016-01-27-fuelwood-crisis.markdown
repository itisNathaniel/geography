**What is it**

* In undeveloped countries, firewood provided main food and heat source for hundreds of years, cheap and renewable
* Inconvenient to gather every day as takes hours to get materials
* In LEDCs vast forest areas cut down as countries grow, 90% of wood in Burkina Faso cut to cook
* 40% of world trees removed to be used as fuel

**Issues**

* Locals aren't intentionally destroying their forest, no real other choice
* Exponentially growing urban population
* More fuel needed to provide people with 3 warm meals each day
* Charcoal used which is same material but 40% less energy
* Charcoal production means the forests are cut down more quickly

**Solutions**

* Ensure people only use real wood to cook, as it's more energy from the same resource
* Fuelwood not a sustainable long-term resource and they'll move to fossil fuels (as cheaper) in the future wheras renewable would be far better for them.
