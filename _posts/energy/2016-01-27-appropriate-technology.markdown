**What is appropriate tecnology?**

> The technological expertise and equipment appropriate for the economic and technological levels  of development in the country

* It means that the tecnology used can be made by the local people with local materials affordably
* Individuals and communities can benefit from the local technology at an affordable price
* Sustainable, so doesn't compromise future ability to use technology
* Intermediate technology can help farmers in poorer nations creating jobs for local labour (not replacing with technology) but uses low cost agriculture techniquies learned from MEDCs.

Appropriate Technology - Kenya's Solar Cookers
</b></div>

* **What are solar cookers:**
	* Outdoor sheets covered in cardboard to cook food and sterilise water
	* Effective in areas that recieve large amounts of sunlight
	* Panel cooker uses shining reflective panels to direct heat into the cooking pot (a clear plastic pot) to absorb heat
	* Can be made by individuals by attaching pieces of tinfoil to card sheets (or purchased for $5)
	* Can use to cook meat, rice or vegetables 
	* Cooks fastest in the middle of the day as warmest.

	*A solar cooker*

* **Why Kenya:**
	* Intense periods of sunlight
	* Cookers easy and cheap to manufacture by local people
	* 78% of population live rurally with no electricity supply
	* $1,600 GDP so people can afford very little
	* Easily to copy so the idea spreads
	* Currently gets 80& of energy from fuelwood so solar cookers would save time, energy and the environment

* **+ Social Benefits**
	* No smoke, reduces respiratory illness risk such as broncitus and asthma
	* Longer cooking times reduce chance of food poisoning
	* Reduces the risk of fires in the home
	* Means home doesn't get as warm in summer from cooking indoors
	* Locals become skilled in the benefits of solar energy

* **+ Environmental Benefits**
	* Reduces reliance on wood for fuel and needless deforestation, less tree felling
	* Natural habitats are maintained and not cut down
	* Risk of desertification removed as trees left
	* A renewable energy resource has been adopted, paving the way for others such as PV (solar panels)
	* Reduces CO2 emissions

* **Evaluation**
	* \- Huge cultural shift needed to move to it
	* \- Depends on weather which is unreliable at higher altidudes
	* \- Only a small scale project, not yet widespread enough  to make a difference
	* \- Meals are hotter at midday, people culturally don't tend to eat until later
	* \- Only suitable really for low protein diets to cook
	* \+ Reduces pressure on the government to immediately provide electricity infrastructure
