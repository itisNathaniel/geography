Chad - managing low energy consumption
</b></div>

* Chad is an LEDC with a 36% agriculture economy, it has very limited reserves, possessing only oil deposits. 
* GNI for country only $600, and the country's civil war ended in 1990.

	![]({{ site.baseurl }}/image/energy/chadmap.gif)
	*Map of Chad*

* **Main sources:**
    * No coal, gas, oil or hydroelectric power
    * 30,000 barrels of oil in 2004 produced, 900 million barrels of oil reserves owned
    * 15,000 barrels are produced per day up until 1980
    * Oil pipeline built to Cameroon costing $93 million

* **Energy Management:**
    * All Chad's powerstations are thermal and powered by fossil fuels
    * Most of population rely on on burning wood for biomass power to provide heat to cook with
    * Total energy production is 103GWh as of 2008, increasing up 21GWh since 2002
    * No solar energy despite the potential to produce 2,800kWh of energy every day
    * No geothermal in use but it's believed there are some geothermal sources that could be used in the future

* **Energy consumption:**
    * Over 80% of energy produced is used in the capital
    * Per capita energy consumption is 12% have electricity in capital and 1% in provinces
    * Wood and charcoal are imported and burned to provide 90% of Chad's energy
    * Less than 11,000 households equipt to use energy
    * Some of highest electricity prices in the world at 15p per kWh, nearby Cameroon's is 8p per kWh

* **Imports and Exports:**
	* They don't extract oil themselves and are entirely reliant on energy imports from Niger and Cameroon
	* Petroleum is imported and stored by Total as well as 10 other TNCs which refine Chad's oil
	* In 2009 Chad estimated to import 2,000 barrels of oil per day
	* They don't trade electricity with any other country

* **Energy management success:**
	* Chad's household energy project of 1998 aimed to inform people about resource conservation
		* \+ Village resource management aimed to limit amount of wood cut down
		* \+ Local governments manage own resources allowing them to make maximum profits
		* \+ Improves energy use in homes and ensure's they're used sustainably
		* \- Only operates in 100 villages
		* \- Hasn't increased availability, still only available to 1% of rural population
		* \+ Country slowly becoming more sustainable

Norway - managing high energy supply
</b></div>

* **Energy consumption**
	* Has a high energy consumption equvilant to 6 tonnes of oil per person
	* High energy consumption as use electricity to heat homes
	* 10 times energy of average EU citizen

	![]({{ site.baseurl }}/image/energy/norway-map.gif)
	*Norway map*
	
* **Main energy sources:**
	* High hydroelectricity use as it's cheap and clean energy, many stations built in 70s and 80s when OPEC problems ongoing
	* As have many waterfalls, dams subsidised by government to provide cheap energy
	* As active for decades dams have paid for themselves
	* Abudant gas reserves and are also 2nd largest gas exporter after Russia
	* Geneerated 128tWh energy 2011 and HEP was 96% of it
	* Increasing supply, as decomissioning smaller systems are putting larger ones into place (replacing a 9MW with an 85MW in one instance)

* **Imports and Exports:**
	* Norway has almost entirely hydropower energy mix so doesn't rely on other countries
	* Imports nuclear energy from Sweeden and Finland and coal energy from Denmark
	* Exports 1.2 million barrels of oil per day
	* Fossil fuels supply 25% of Norway's GDP
	* Fuel prices highest in Europe in Norway to encourage sustainability
	* Plan has worked well as they're able to influence other countries energy mixes through the *initiative for clean energy* to make developing countries more aware of how they shoud use their petrol resources
