Conserving energy in the home - BedZed
</b></div>
* About:
	* UK's first carbon-neutral eco-community
	* 100 homes, 50% private, 25% leased and 25% social housing
	* 1600sqm of office space
	* Opened in 2002 and now is home to 200 residents
	* Created a zero-emission living space which used zero fossil fuels

		*BedZed, London*
* Objectives: 
	* Create living space using zero fossil fuels
	* Reduce transport emissions by 50% using shared carpools and low-emission vehicles
	* 60% reduction in domestic energy
	* 90% reduction in heating energy
	* 30% less water used as rainwater used to flush toilets
	* Materials sourced in 60km radius to ensure no high import costs
	* Developed biodiversity in open garden areas

* Building:
	* BedZed built on a brownfield site that was disused and was sold on by Sutton council at less than market value to be redeveloped 
	* Houses sold at normal market price so affordable to local people

* Success and shortfalls:
