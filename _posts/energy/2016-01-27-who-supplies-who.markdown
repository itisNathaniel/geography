Patterns:

* Europe imports largest proportion (50%) of energy from the countries that made up the former Soviet Union (including Russia)
* Largest individual country supplying oil to Europe is Saudi Arabia (22%), due to the vast and cheap oil reserves in the middle-east
* Africa supply 19%, despite being world's smallest users they're a large producer.
