**Renewable:**

* Biomass:
	* Produced by burning dead of decaying organic materials (i.e plants or animal waste)
	* Also can be grown specially for burning (rapeseed oil is commonly used)
	* \+ Cheap and can be planted and used in scalable amounts
	* \+ If used instead of biomass can create a long-term sustainable resource
	* \- Still produces CO2 when burn (it's just offset from when the plant grew)
	* \- Not sustainable if new crops aren't grown in place of the burnt ones

* Wind:
	* Generated by wind turning a turbine, which in turn rotates a generator and produces an electric current
	* \+ Apart from initial installation and annual maintenance has no cost
	* \- Amount of power that can be generated varies hugely on wind, if there's little wind, little power is generated
	* \- Turbines are noisy so residents object to them as they make noise, spoil their view and reduce their home value
	* \- To replace a single reactor, 450 wind turbines are needed

* Solar:
	* Generated by panels with photovoltaic (PV) cells that produce a current when exposed to light 
	* Many of these connected together across large fields or on roofs can reduce the need for conventional power stations
	* \+ Free to operate and harvest sunlight but panels are expensive
	* \+ Can be used in remote areas not connected to a power grid
	* \- Need over 70,000sqft of panels to replace a nuclear power station
	* \- Can only harvest sunlight in daytime when sunny

* Tidal power
	* Caused by moon, as tides move twice a day, tidal dams built onshore. 
	* As water flows in at high tide and low tide water moves in and out spinning the turbine
	* \+ Renewable and won't run out
	* \+ Equivilant to 3 nuclear power stations
	* \+ Free apart from construction or maintenance
	* \- High construction cost and not yet cost effective as technology not developed enough
	* \- Actually generate for only a short period when tide in or out  

**Non-renewable**

* Coal
	* Formed from fossilised plants and animals
	* Mined from the layers between rocks then burned to generate energy
	* \+ Fuel made naturually ready to use
	* \+ Large supplies which will outlast both oil and gas
	* \- Produces greenhouse gases which pollute the atmosphere

* Oil
	* Formed from fossilised plants and animals 
	* Oil lakes between the rocks inside the earth, collected from using pipes
	* Oil then used in transport and industry 
	* \+ Once collected can be used immediately
	* \+ Cheap to extract and convert to energy
	* \- Creates large amounts of atmospheric pollution
	* \- Finite supply with only around 50 years left

* Natural gas:
	* Methane and other gases trapped between rock
	* Pipes collect and release gas
	* Often used in houses to heat and cook
	* \+ Ready to use straight after extraction
	* \+ Cheap to extract and convert to energy
	* \+ Cleaner fuel than oil and coal
	* \- Still release greenhouse gases
	* \- Supply very limited, less than 70 years left

* Nuclear
	* Radioactive materials such as uranium are mined
	* Electricity generated from energy released by the atoms split by nuclear fission
	* Small size radioactive sources create large energy amounts
	* Raw nuclear material cheap and will last a long time
	* Don't pollute the atmosphere
	* \- Expensive to run and maintain the power stations
	* \- Nuclear waste highly dangerous and has to be contained for thousands of years before safe
	* Nuclear leaks can result in radiation poisoning water, people, animals or the environment and cause potential disaster (i.e Cherynobyl, Ukraine, 1986).
