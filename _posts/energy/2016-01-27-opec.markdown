*Map of OPEC member countries*

**About:**

* Formed 1960 to manage oil post WWII, founding memebers Venezuela, Iraq and Kuwait 
* Manages 70% of the world's oil reserves
* Produces 15% of both world oil and natural gas
* Restrain competition by setting fixed quotas that its members can export to ensure that its members make maximim profit
* Allows the organisation to increase or decrease world petroleum supply due to controlling many countries 
* The majority of member countries are in the Middle-East and Africa

**Aims**

* Protect interests of member countries who provide oil
* Originally in 1960 designed to stop falling and stabilise oil price
* Ensure oil provided efficiently and ensure regular oil supply

**Controversy:** 

* In 1973 OPEC restricted oil production to inflate the price of oil
* 1973 crisis meant problems for the US as fuel stations couldn't afford prices so ran out of fuel to sell
* OPEC members were able to exploit the system for maximum profit and accomplish short-term interests for countries
* Restrictions failed as they don't control everyone's oil, non-members like Russia start producing more at a lower price and reap the profits
* In 1981 OPEC increased prices to $40 per barrel which was unaffordable for most countries
* Countries started focussing on alternate energy sources, such as Norway heavily investing into Nuclear power
* After pressure eventualy caved and reduced prices
