* Asia will become more dependant on oil from the middle-east
* US will increase oil and gas imports as demand grows
* Nuclear energy will be debated more as a viable replacement for fossil fuels, despite the concerns for safety by a few
* Russia will become even more dominant in natural gas supply due to the large cross-europe pipeline it owns
* Overall sustainability will be increased with more environmentally energy sources chosen and Norway's footpath followed in
