**What is it:**

* Major problem in the 1980s
* More fumes containing nitric and sulfuric acid released meaning more pollutants in the air due to cars amongst other activities
* Causes issues in North America as large area of forest lost and damage to industry

**Caused by:**

* Natural sources such as volcanic emissions, gases creating higer than normal amounts of acid rain
* Wildfires and decay of vegitation make more acid rain causing gases
* Cars that release nitrogen and sulphur in exhaust fumes 
* Industrial areas with large amounts of traffic and power plants release gases that react with substances in the air to make nitric acid and sulphuric acid

**Acid rain types:**

* Wet deposition:
	* Wind blows chemicals so fall to ground as sleet/snow
	* Acidic water moves into canals and effects marine life as well as the sea
* Dry deposition
	* Wind blows acidic chemicals to where dry weather
	* Pollutions become a part of smoke and fall to the ground as dry particulates 
	* Pollutions washed from earth by rainstorms

**Effects of acid rain:**

* Aquatic issues as raises pH of water and kills marine life including fish
* Forestry probelms as makes trees vulnerable to disease and damages bark
* Effects soil as soil chemistry can't maintain optimum pH, causes stunted plant growth
* Buildings damaged as reacts with minerals in limestone and corrodes them away
* Affects buildings, cars, bridges and pipes and irreversable damage to old buildings and degrade marble

**Solutions:**

* Clean exhaust and factory chimneys using chemical scrubbers to chemically remove sulpur from emissions
* Adding lime to lakes and rivers to undo pH change
* Cleaner energy such as geothermal, solar or hydropower
* Government policy, making too high emissions illegal

Acid Rain - Canada	
</b></div>

* **Causes**
	* USA main pollution producer which moves by wind from US to Canada
	* Acid rain moves to Canada with neutral soil meaning becomes acid
	* Most Canada granite which is susceptible to acid rain and no natural buffer to acid

* **Damages**
	* 14,000 lakes acidic killing plants and birds
	* Spruce, fir and pine being killed and growth stunted
	* Pollution causing respiratory diseases like bronchitus and asthma
	* 84% of agricultural land polluted by acid rin
	* Marble and limestone buildings dissolved away meaning 4% weight decrease per year

* **Solutions**
	* On a small scale trees can be sprayed down to wash off acid and reduce impact, doesn't however work for large areas
	* Canada replacing coal power with gas power to reduce pollution
	* Lime added to rivers, lakes and soil to neutralise acid which is very expensive
	* Power station scrubbers remove sodium and nitrogen oxides, expensive for power stations but very effective
