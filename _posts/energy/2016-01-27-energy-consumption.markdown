**General patterns:**

* The northern hemisphere uses 80% of the worlds energy but has only 20% of the world's population
* 90% of motorised vehicles in the northern hemisphere
* In future north's energy use will need to be managed or reduced or there will not be enough power for the developing southern hemisphere as its population grows and technology develops

**ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ UK consumption case study - MEDC**

* Greatest amount of UK energy is supplied by gas, which is 38% of the total for the world
* Oil is the 2nd largest supply at 35%
* Renewables only make up 2% of the UK energy mix
* Historic changes:
	* Since 1970 UK energy use has decreased despite the the population increasing by 6.5 million due to more efficient technology
	* Since 1970 households are using 12% less electricity and industry is using around 60% less
	* Transport has increased by 50% though as 17 million more vehicles are on the road
	* 54 million less tonnes of coal used every year since 1970
	* In 1990 oil dependance was reduced and gas became more prominent 
* Primary energy supply
	* 38% gas, 35% oil, 17% coal, 9% nuclear, 6% nuclear 
* Domenstic production
	* 43% of UK domestic production is from oil, 38% is from gas and 33% nuclear
	* Only 5% of UK domestic production is renewable
	* In 1970 coal accounted for 60% of all electricity production in UK, now less than 30%
	* Oil dependence decreased 220,000 tonnes since 1970
* Net imports:
	* 87% of UK imports are solid fuels, 20% are gas and 6% renewables
	* UK imports nuclear materials as doesn't have large nuclear reserves
	* Coal and oil is imported by the UK as cheaper to import from offshore or abroad than mine
