**Per-capita energy use:**

* LEDCs in middle east habe high per capita energy consumption as the richest use large amounts of energy
* North America becoming more sustainable, per capita use decreased since 1980
* Per capita use in general increased since 1980, in LEDCs by 0.2 tonnes of oil per capita, in MEDCs by 0.5 tonnes
* North America has the highest per capita energy usage still in 2000, 5.3 tonnes of oil per person

**Energy types:**

* LEDCs recieve 50% of their energy from energy sources that can't be measured such as fuelwood
* Southern Asia have 2bn people using wood and biomass for their primary energy resource
* LEDCs tend to use more coal, oil and HEP than MEDCs as well as less gas and nuclear power
* In Africa more than 500 million people depend on fuelwood
* MEDCs get most energy from fossil fuels, in US where 30% of power comes from 
* Europe largest overall power source is Nuclear energy, 36% of total supply

**Ways energy is used:**

* LEDCs use a higher percentage of energy for industry and residential uses (35% compared to 25%)
* LEDCs and MEDCs both use same proportion of their energy for agriculture (5%)
* MEDCs use 20% of energy for transport, whereas LEDCs only use 20%
* MEDCs use 10% of energy for commerce, LEDCs only use 5%

How energy demand has changed over time:

**Pre-1760:**

* Demand for coal and oil was low for whole world
* No electricity, cars or planes

**1760:**

* First industrial revolution
* Coal desire increased dramatically for trains and manufacturing machines

**1760-1900:**

* Industrial revolution for western world
* World energy use increases due to new construction and transport methods

**1900-1960:**

* New advancements such as cars and planes 
* Increased worldwide demand for transport as homes and factories electrified

**1960-current:**

* All-time high electricity demand  
* Entire western world has electricity
* New devices such as TVs, fridges and phones using electricity too
* In 1999 USA consumption reached per capita consumption 3x LEDCs

**Current-2060:**

* Demand for energy outstrips supply
* Vast population increase and industrialisation drives growth more
* By 2040 energy need will be 30% higher than present day
