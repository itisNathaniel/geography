	* In 2009 Russia overtook Saudi Arabia and became world's top exporter of oil, 10 million barrels per day
	* It has an alliance with OPEC where Russia can negotiate group price increases
	* Putin claims to have improved 142 million lives and increased prosperity
	* 10% drop in GDP in 2009 and a shrinking economy
	* Russia uses energy supplies as a weapon to *bend the wills* of other countries 
	* Gazprom pipeline one of world's most powerful companies and is world's largest single gas supply
		* It controls 1/3 of the world's gas reserves

		*The Gazprom Pipelines*

* **Exports:**
	* 60% of Russia's total exports are oil
	* High taxes on energy means that the government reaps huge profits from the sale of energy
	* Russia increased political influence as exports 25,000 thousand barrels of oil to west per day and 5,000 to China

* **Using influence against Ukraine:**
	* Ukraine was too dependant on Russia and used the Gazprom pipeline as only gas supply in area
	* As a state managed monopoly they cut Ukraine's oil supply repeatedly, most recenetly in 2015
	* In 2014, 300 deaths due to both dispute between Ukraine and Russia and due to freezing to death due to cut of gas supply

* **Europe Energy Security:**
	* Dangerous to depend:
		* Russia have a lot of dependance on them from different countries
		* Dangerous to risk Europe's power supply on one country's supply
		* Previously cut supply to Ukraine, Poland, Bulgaria and Romainia in previous disagreements 
		* Russia can manipulate politics of countries and blackmail using energy security
	* Not dangerous to depend:
		* Supplies remained stable in the cold war
		* Won't cut off whole of Europe supply as a business, they need customers
		* EU are already looking at diversifying sources and using sustainable instead
		* Currently buying gas at locked prices which are reasonable
